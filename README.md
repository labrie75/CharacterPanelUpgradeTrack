# CharacterPanelUpgradeTrack
Simple WoW addon for displaying the upgrade track on the items in the character panel

Know issues:

- DONE: ~~Need to exclude Heirlooms since they have upgrade levels as well.~~ This was caused by another addon.
- DONE: ~~At the moment each time the character panel is opened or gear is changed a new text is created. I need to clear the old ones.~~
